# About

This is likely to be my CS Capstone project, which I'm going to revamp throughout this next year.

# Controls

Use <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to navigate the menus. <br>
Use <kbd>WASD</kbd> to move, <kbd>H</kbd> to dash and <kbd>J</kbd> to attack.

# Credits

Generally, art has been jigsawed from free sources and/or made by me <br>
Big thanks to peerjs and p5js for making p2p communication and canvas art that much simpler
