# About

This is a project i'm pretty hyped to work on :) <br>
It uses the PeerJS library to allow communication between static sites without having to host a custom server.

It also uses the p5JS library to handle the graphical aspect of the game.

# Credits

Generally, art has been jigsawed from countless authors working for free across the internet. <br>
**Huge thank you to them for making my game look nice :)**

Otherwise, this was all me! <br>
That being said, PLEASE, mess with my game! Make it crash! And then, open lots of issues on Github. That would be very much appreciated.
