# About

This is a project I was pretty hyped to work on :) <br>
It uses the Driveline library for communications, but unfortunately it was depreciated and as such the game is generally no longer functional. I may come back and patch it at a later date.

# Controls

Use <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to navigate the menus. <br>
Use <kbd>WASD</kbd> to move, <kbd>H</kbd> to dash and <kbd>J</kbd> to attack.

# Upcoming

Note that you can read the issues tab for more up to date information. <br>
* Sound
* Death Effects
* Winning the Game
* Different Controls

# Credits

Generally, art has been jigsawed from countless authors working for free across the internet. <br>
**Huge thank you to them for making my game look nice :)**

Otherwise, this was all me! <br>
That being said, PLEASE, mess with my game! Make it crash! And then, open lots of issues on Github. <br>
Improvements are always good.
